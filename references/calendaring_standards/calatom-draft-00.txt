Internet-Draft                   CalAtom                  September 2006


1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   The Atom Publishing Protocol (atompub) uses HTTP methods to edit and
   author Member Resources.  Atompub Collections can contain Member
   Resources with representations of arbitrary media type.  The Atom
   Publishing Protocol defines Media Resources and Media Link Entries to
   support the editing and authoring of Member Resources in media types
   other than application/atom+xml.  This specification uses those
   constructs together with the "application/calendar+xml" media type
   (xcal) to provide a remote api for a Calendaring.  The api has been
   designed to work with existing calendaring implementations.


3.  CalAtom Collections

   This specification defines Calendar Atom Collections (alternatively
   referred to as CalAtom Collections).  These collections allow for the
   editing and authoring of calendar data in its xcal representation and
   provide calendar specific query operations.

   CalAtom collections MUST support xcal representations of the calendar
   data.  The xcal representations MUST contain one and only one VEVENT
   calendar component.  Additionally the representation MUST NOT specify
   the iCalendar METHOD property.


4.  Service Document in CalAtom

   For event management to occur, a client needs to first discover the
   capabilities and locations of the available CalAtom Collections.  The
   ATOM Publishing Protocols Service Documents are designed to support
   this discovery process.

   In addition to providing the standard collection details in the
   Service document CalAtom collections MUST surface additional
   information to indicate calendar specific capabilities.

   </collection>
  </workspace>
 </service

   This service document describes a single workspace that contains two
   atom collections.  The first Workspace, called "Main Site", has two
   collections called "My Calendar" and "Pictures" whose IRIs are
   "http://example.org/reilly/calendar" and
   "http://example.org/reilly/pic" respectively.  The "My Calendar"
   collection includes an "accept" element indicating that a client can
   post xcal media types to the Collection to create new members.
   Additionally, two atom extensions are also present in the collection
   element.  The "feature" element indicates that this collection
   supports calatom and the "url" element provides a template used for
   querying the calendar.

4.2.  Element Definitions

Internet-Draft                   CalAtom                  September 2006


4.2.1.  The "f:feature" Element

   A feature is an abstract behavior, function and capability supported
   by an Atom Publishing Protocol server.  Examples of features that
   might be supported by an APP server include support for a particular
   set of Atom format extensions, a particular authentication scheme, or
   a specific set of behaviors.  The presence of a f:feature element in
   an app:collection element is an indication that the collection
   supports the feature and may require that a client wishing to use the
   endpoint use that feature.  Features are identified using permanent,
   universally unique IRI's.

        feature = element f:feature {
          undefinedAttribute*,
          attribute ref { atomNCName | atomUri },
          (extensionElement*)
        }

   The "ref" attribute identifies a feature supported by a collection.
   The value of "ref" MUST be a string that is non-empty and matches
   either the "isegment-nz-nc" or the "IRI" production in [RFC3987].
   Note that use of a relative reference other than a simple name is not
   allowed.  If a name is given, implementations MUST consider the value
   equivalent to the same name registered within the IANA Registry of
   Publishing Features, and thus to the IRI that would be obtained by
   appending the value of the ref attribute to the string
   "http://www.iana.org/assignments/features/".  The value of the ref
   attribute MUST be compared on a case-sensitive, character-by-
   character basis.

   The f:feature element MAY contain child elements and attributes other
   than those defined in this specification.  Such "foreign markup" are
   considered to be metadata applicable to the feature identified by the
   f:feature element.  Software agents MUST NOT stop processing or
   signal an error or change their behavior as a result of encountering
   such foreign markup.

   An app:collection element MAY contain zero or more f:feature elements
   but MUST NOT contain more than one with the same ref attribute value.

   CalAtom collections MUST contain an f:feature element with a "ref"
   attribute set to
   "http://purl.org/calatom/draft-yates-atompub-calatom-00.txt" <-- this
   will be updated once the spec is finalized.  CalAtom collections MUST
   also "accept" posts of media type application/calendar+xml.

4.2.2.  The "f:url" Element

   A url template provides a parameterized uri, typically used to
   construct a search request.  Clients perform parameter substitution
   to construct a de-referencable uri.

        url = element ca:url {
          undefinedAttribute*,
          attribute rel { atomNCName | atomUri },
          attribute template {atomUri},
          (extensionElement*)
        }

   The "rel" attribute identifies a specific template/search type
   supported by a collection, for example a "Date Range" query over
   calendar resources.  The value of "rel" MUST be a string that is non-
   empty and that matches the "IRI" production in [RFC3987].  The value
   of the "rel" attribute MUST be compared on a case-sensitive,
   character-by-character basis.

   The "template" attribute contains a "URI Template" <--- reference
   appropriate specification when available.  The client performs
   parameter substitution on this template to construct a dereferencable
   URI.

   CalAtom collections MUST provide a ca:url element in the CalAtom
   f:feature element with the "rel" attribute set to "http://purl.org/
   calatom/draft-yates-atompub-calatom-00.txt/daterange" <---- updated
   when the spec is released.  Clients use this value of the "rel"
   attribute to identify the "Date Range" template URI.  The template
   URI MUST contain ca:startdate and ca:enddate substitution parameters.
   See the "Date Range Search" section below for definitions of the
   substitution parameters.


5.  Creating and Editing Calendar Resources

5.1.  Creating Calendar Resources with POST

   A client can POST an xcal media type of application/calendar+xml to a
   CalAtom Collection.  Such a request creates two new resources - one
   that corresponds to the xcal entity sent in the request, and an
   associated Member Entry, called the CalAtom Media Link Entry.  See
   section 9.5 of atompub for a complete description of Media Resources
   and Media Link Entries.

   The CalAtom Media Link Entry's "title" element SHOULD be populated
   with the value of the "summary" element in the corresponding xcal



                          Expires April 2, 2007                 [Page 6]

   Media Resource.

5.1.1.  Example

   Below, the client sends a POST request containing a xcal
   representation to the URI of the CalAtom collection.

   POST /reilly/calendar HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.org
   User-Agent: Thingio/1.0
   Content- Type: application/calendar+xml
   Content-Length: nnn
   <iCalendar xmlns="http://www.ietf.org/internet
         -drafts/draft-ietf-calsch-many-xcal-02.txt">

       prodid="-//hacksw/handcal//NONSGML 1.0//EN">
     <vevent>
      <uid>20060901T130000Z-123401@host.com</uid>
      <dtstamp>20060901T130000Z</dtstamp>
      <dtstart>20060903T163000Z</dtstart>

           <item>Human Resources</item>
      </categories>
     </vevent>
    </vcalendar>
   </iCalendar>

   The server signals a successful creation with a status code of 201.
   The response includes a Location header indicating the Member URI of
   the CalAtom Media Link Entry and a representation of that entry in
   the body of the response.  The CalAtom Media Link Entry includes a
   content element with a src attribute, and a link using the link
   relation "edit-media" specifying the IRI to be used for modifying the
   xcal Media Resource.

   </entry>

5.2.  Modifying and Deleteing Calendar Resources

   CalAtom Media Link Entries i.e. entries that reference calendar
   resources in CalAtom collections MUST contain an "edit-media" link
   relation specifying the IRI to be used for modifying or deleting the
   resource.  GET, PUT and DELETE operations as described in atompub
   section 5.4 can then be used to view or manipulate the resource.
   CalAtom collections MUST provide an "edit-media" link relation with
   media-type application/calendar+xml and MAY provide alternative
   represenations.


6.  Date Range Search

   Calendar applications most frequently display calendar events for a
   given date range.  The "Date Range Search" allows a client to provide
   the ranges start and end dates and returns the results in an atom
   feed format.

6.1.  URI Construction

   CalAtom collections MUST provide a "Date Range Search" URI template
   in the Atom Service Document.  Clients MUST replace the parameters in
   this template to construct a URI.

   Two parameters in the URI template are replaceable i.e. "ca:
   startdate" and "ca:enddate".  These two parameters indicate a date
   range.  When substituted the constructed URI is dereferenceable and



                          Expires April 2, 2007                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft                   CalAtom                  September 2006


   the server response MUST include CalAtom Media Link Entries that
   reference a Calendar resource with an event who's start and end time
   overlap the provided date range.

6.1.1.  Example

   In the following example the client requests all events that occur in
   the month of September 2006.  The atompub introspection document
   contains the following URI Template "http://example.org/reilly/
   calendar?startdate={ca:startdate}&enddate={ca:enddate}".

    GET /reilly/calendar
     ?startdate=200609001T000000Z&enddate=200609001T115959Z HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.org
    User-Agent: Thingio/1.0
    Accept: application/atom+xml

   The client has substituted the parameters{ca:startdate} and {ca:
   enddate}.  The server responds with the results in Atom Feed format.

   The response contains two events, "Annual Employee Review" and
   "Annual Manager Review" both occuring in September 06.  The CalAtom
   Media Link Entries in the response also contain the "xcal:dtstart"
   and "xcal:dtend" elements.

6.2.  Search Response

   The Date Range Search Response MUST provide representations in the
   form of Atom Feed documents whose CalAtom media entries represent the



                          Expires April 2, 2007                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft                   CalAtom                  September 2006


   Calendar Resources that qualify.  Each entry in the Feed Document
   SHOULD have an atom:link element with a relation of "edit-media".
   The Search Response MAY be paged, see section 10.1 atompub.

6.2.1.  xcal Elements

   The CalAtom media entries in the Date Range Search Response MUST
   contain the following xcal elements as immediate children of the
   "atom:entry" when the elements exist in the corresponding Calendar
   Resource, "xcal:location", "xcal:dtstart", "xcal:dtend", "xcal:
   status", "xcal:organizer".


7.  Listing CalAtom Collection Members

   CalAtom collections MUST respond to GET requests with a member
   listing as outlined in atompub section 10.  Typically atom clients
   use this default listing as their primary listing.  CalAtom clients
   however will normally use the "Date Range Query" as their primary
   listing of events.  It is, however, expected that the default
   collection listing will be used to "synch" calendar clients with the
   server.  Therefore in the default collection listing CalAtom Media
   Entries SHOULD contain a full inline representation of the Media
   Resource in media type application/calendar+xml.  The listing SHOULD
   also be paged.

7.1.  Example

   Below is a sample default listing of a CalAtom Collection that
   contains two events.

      GET /reilly/calendar
      Host: example.org
      User-Agent: Thingio/1.0
      Accept: application/atom+xml

   The server responds as follows.
