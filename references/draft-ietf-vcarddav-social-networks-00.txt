Internet-Draft               vCard-Extension                October 2011


1.  Introduction

   [[anchor1: Barry: This version is still very incomplete.  I have
   included some comments in the appropriate places with the XML "cref"
   element, so they will show up within "[[ ]]", as this one does.  I am
   still working on these, and I also want to put in a lot more
   properties (see Peter's comment, below).]]

   As social networking has become common, it has become clear that
   users would like to include information in their vCards [RFC6350]
   about their social networks.  Well organized social network
   information allows the vCard owner to share his profile information
   and to import or subscribe to profile information of others on
   joining a new network.

   This extension takes some property definitions from the vCard OMA CAB
   Extensions [I-D.ietf-vcarddav-oma-cab-extensions], and that document
   should be considered as a prerequisite to this one.

1.1.  Terminology Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].  These
   terms take their normative meaning only when presented in ALL CAPS.

   Syntax specifications shown here use the augmented Backus-Naur Form
   (ABNF) as described in [RFC5234], and are specified as in the base
   vcard specification [RFC6350].


2.  Social Network Properties

   These properties are related to sharing social-network information.
   The basis for some of these properties came from the "Friend of a
   Friend" specification [FOAF], and we thank the authors of that
   document for their work.

   [[anchor2: Barry: Are there more FoaF items we want to include?]]

   [[anchor3: Peter StA: There are many "social networking" properties
   outside of FOAF, so using only what's currently in FOAF is somewhat
   limiting.  Borrowing from http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0154.html
   I'd mention at least the following...]]

   [[anchor4: a.  URLs for avatar (or actual avatar data), biography,
   online status or presence, publication list, photo site, resume / CV,
   weblog, wishlist]]

Internet-Draft               vCard-Extension                October 2011


   [[anchor5: b. personal attributes like eye color, hair color, height,
   weight, marital status, smoker / non-smoker, zodiac sign (both
   Chinese and Western), psychological profile (e.g., Myers-Briggs Type
   Indicator)]]

   [[anchor6: c. other interesting facts such as areas of expertise,
   clubs of which the object is a member, charitable organizations
   supported, dietary preferences, hobbies, interests, profession,
   religious affiliation]]

   [[anchor7: d. various favorite things, such as activities, authors,
   individual athletes as well as sports teams, beverages, charitable
   organizations, chatrooms / IRC channels / forums, foods, games,
   movies, music, places, quotes, TV shows, weblogs, websites]]

   [[anchor8: e. places lived, schools attended, conferences attended
   (complete list of all IETF meetings you've been to?), etc.]]

   [[anchor9: The list goes on!]]

   [[anchor10: Clearly there is a *lot* of information that one could
   include under the "social networking" umbrella.  I don't know how
   much of that possible universe the authors wish to represent here.]]

   [[anchor11: (Personally I'd be willing to help define a broader set
   of properties than the few already included here, since I did quite a
   bit of thinking about the topic several years ago when working on
   XEP-0154.)]]

2.1.  Property: OPENID

   [[anchor12: Barry: Maybe this should be something like
   "authentication;type=openid:" instead?  That would allow for other
   authentication types.]]

   Namespace:

   Property name:  OPENID

   Purpose:  OpenID is an open, decentralized user identification
       standard, allowing users to log onto many services with the same
       digital identity.  Inclusion of an OpenID URI in a vCard lets
       others add the vCard owner's ID to their authorization lists.
       [[anchor13: Barry: We should add an informative reference to
       OpenID.]]

Internet-Draft               vCard-Extension                October 2011


   Value type:  A single URI value.

   Cardinality:  *

   Property parameters:  (none)

   Description:

   Format definition:
       OPENID-param =  pid-param / pref-param /
               any-param
       OPENID-value =  uri

   Example:

     OPENID:http://www.alice.openid.example.org

2.2.  Property: SOCIALPROFILE

   [[anchor14: Dany: SERVICE in OMA-CAB and SOCIALPROFILE here seem very
   similar and both need more details on LABEL for SERVICE or on TYPE
   for SOCIALPROFILE.  To me, SERVICE (in OMA-CAB) is more complete.]]

   [[anchor15: Simon: I see significant overlap among the following:
   SOCIALPROFILE (from here), SERVICE (from OMA-CAB), SERVICE-TYPE (from
   draft-daboo-vcard-service-type).  I would expect the authors to work
   amongst themselves on merging those proposals, or at least
   eliminating the overlap (e.g. reusing parts defined in another
   draft).]]

   Namespace:

   Property name:  SOCIALPROFILE

   Purpose:  Designates the vCard owner's profile page on a particular
       social network.

   Value type:  A single URI value.

   Cardinality:  *

   Property parameters:  TYPE

   Description:  This property SHOULD include the parameter "TYPE" to
       specify the name of the social network that it refers to.
       Usually, that will also be discernible from the URI, which is why
       it's optional.  But it can be helpful to have it specified
       explicitly.

Internet-Draft               vCard-Extension                October 2011


   Format definition:
       SOCIALPROFILE-param =  pid-param / pref-param /
               any-param
       SOCIALPROFILE-value =  uri

   Examples:

     SOCIALPROFILE;type=linkedin:http://www.linkedin.com/in/barryleiba

     SOCIALPROFILE;type=facebook:http://www.facebook.com/barackobama

2.3.  Property: ALBUM

   Namespace:

   Property name:  ALBUM

   Purpose:  Designates an online album, such as a photo album or video
       album.

   Value type:  A single URI value.

   Cardinality:  *

   Property parameters:  TYPE

   Description:  This property SHOULD include the parameter "TYPE" to
       specify the type of album that it refers to.  Usually, that will
       also be discernible from the URI, which is why it's optional.
       But it can be helpful to have it specified explicitly.

   Format definition:
       ALBUM-param =  pid-param / pref-param /
               any-param
       ALBUM-value =  uri

   Example:

     ALBUM;type=photo:http://picasaweb.google.com/barryleiba
     ALBUM;type=video:http://www.youtube.com/user/barryleiba

2.4.  Property: DEPICTION

   [[anchor16: Barry: After reading the FoaF description of "depiction",
   I get the point now, I think.  I've re-written this to take a stab at
   it.  I've included a reference to a corporate logo, but Simon points
   out that we also have LOGO in the base, so maybe that part shouldn't
   be here.]]

Internet-Draft               vCard-Extension                October 2011


   Namespace:

   Property name:  DEPICTION

   Purpose:  To note that the referenced URI depicts, in come way, the
       entity represented by this vCard.

   Value type:  A single URI value.

   Cardinality:  *

   Property parameters:

   Description:  DEPICTION can be used to point to images in online
       photo galleries, specifying which ones include the subject of
       this vCard (perhaps in addition to other people or things).

       DEPICTION might also be used to refer to videos, icons, avatars,
       or the like.  Consider someone's avatars in virtual worlds, or
       one or more corporate logos in a vCard representing a company.

       This is distinct from the PHOTO property, in that the latter is
       meant to define a specific representation of the vCard subject (a
       "profile photo", or a publicity headshot, say), while DEPICTION
       might often be used to say that the subject appears in a group
       photo or in a photo that is primarily a picture of something or
       someone else.

   Format definition:
       DEPICTION-param =  pid-param / pref-param /
               any-param
       DEPICTION-value =  uri

   Example:  Suppose a gallery contains the following photos:
           IMG_001.jpg: Alexey and Barry at a reception.
           IMG_002.jpg: Alexey, Chris, and Dave having a conversation.
           IMG_003.jpg: Barry making a comment in the plenary session.
           IMG_004.jpg: A meeting session that Alexey, Barry, Chris,
           Dave, and Eric are all attending.

       Barry's vCard might include the following:

     DEPICTION:http://www.example.com/pub/photos/IMG_001.jpg
     DEPICTION:http://www.example.com/pub/photos/IMG_003.jpg
     DEPICTION:http://www.example.com/pub/photos/IMG_004.jpg

Internet-Draft               vCard-Extension                October 2011


2.5.  Property: SOCIALCODE

   [[anchor17: Simon: The use of the TYPE parameter here is
   underspecified.  It isn't clear whether the TYPE value is a free-form
   string of if it needs to be registered somewhere.  Will it be
   displayed to the user?]]

   Namespace:

   Property name:  SOCIALCODE

   Purpose:  Description of the vCard owner, in the form of a "social
       code", such as the "geek code" (see
       http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geek_code).  Social codes are
       popularly used to exchange a large amount of social information
       in a compact way, and provide a somewhat frivolous and willfully
       obscure "fun" mechanism for characterizing technical expertise,
       interests, and habits.

   Value type:  A single text value.

   Cardinality:  *

   Property parameters:  TYPE

   Description:  This property MUST include the parameter "TYPE" to
       specify the type of social network code being used.  There are no
       predefined values for "TYPE", here -- the types will be
       understood (or not) by the vCard users.

       Implementations need to be especially careful with character
       quoting in this property, because these codes tend to use odd
       characters, and many might require quoting [RFC6350].

   Format definition:
       SOCIALCODE-param =  pid-param / pref-param /
               any-param
       SOCIALCODE-value =  text

   Example:

     SOCIALCODE;type=geek:"s: a--"

           [Which means "I'm average size, and my age is 20-24."]

2.6.  Property: INTEREST

   [[anchor18: Dany: INTEREST is defined both here and in OMA-CAB.  Both
   definitions have interesting parameters (INDEX and LEVEL in OMA-CAB
   and TYPE here).  To me, these 2 definitions may be combined.]]

   Namespace:

   Property name:  INTEREST

   Purpose:  Lists the vCard owner's interests (social, recreational,
       technical, etc.).  This allows users to identify others with
       common interests.

   Value type:  A string value consisting of one or more text values
       separated by a COMMA character (ASCII decimal 44).

   Cardinality:  *

   Property parameters:  TYPE, LANGUAGE

   Description:  This property MAY include the parameter "TYPE" to group
       interests in categories.  TYPE might be used to separate
       "business" interests from "social" interests, for example.  There
       are no predefined values for "TYPE", here -- the types will be
       understood (or not) by the vCard users, and it's likely that an
       ad hoc taxonomy will develop, as has happened with social
       tagging.

       [[anchor19: Simon: I think this is fine, but please specify
       whether this string is intended to be displayed to the user or
       not.  (In the base spec, it is not intended to be displayed
       as-is.  Instead, we expect the vCard app to understand the TYPE
       value and show something appropriate (either text or an icon).
       This is made possible because there is a registry of allowed
       values that defines their semantics.)]]

   Format definition:
       INTEREST-param =  pid-param / pref-param /
               any-param
       INTEREST-value =  text

   Example:

     INTEREST;type=business:Internet standards,consulting,job offers
     INTEREST;type=social:friends and family,new friends
     INTEREST;type=hobby:model trains,reading Sci Fi,travel
     INTEREST;type=music:classical,jazz,folk,opera

2.7.  Property: XX

   [[anchor20: Template for adding another property, because we expect
   to add more properties here.  Remove this section before
   publishing.]]  (This will also hold some references for the time
   being: [RFC2425] [RFC2426] [RFC2739] [RFC4770] )

   Namespace:

   Property name:

   Purpose:

   Value type:  A single text value.

   Cardinality:  *

   Property parameters:  VALUE, LANGUAGE

   Description:

   Format definition:
       XX-param =  pid-param / pref-param /
               any-param
       XX-value =  text

   Example:

     xx:zz


3.  Security Considerations

   This presents no security considerations beyond those in section 9 of
   the base vcard specification [RFC6350].

   [[anchor21: Barry: I'm quite sure there's more to say here, and that
   there are some real security (and privacy) considerations, so this is
   just a placeholder.  We need to think about this seriously before
   we're done.]]


4.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to add the following entries to the vCard
   Properties registry, defined in [RFC6350] section 10.3.1.
