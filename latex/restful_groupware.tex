\section{Introduction}

Although computers became ubiquitous for some time now, they still don't help
their users with their most basic information management needs: Make contacts,
calendars, notices and to do items available across different devices and share
them with family and peers.

Existing solutions are either based on non-free software (Microsoft Outlook),
brittle and unreliable\footnote{See comments on the individual projects in
  appendix ...} or require the user to trust his personal data to the commercial
interests of a multinational corporation.

TODO Überleitung

A section about OpenSocial (\autoref{sec:opensocial}) provides additional
motivation for a restful API for social data. It also uses the opportunity to
provide an alternative approach to explain the rest architecture by going into
detail why OpenSocial is not restful.

A few patterns or techniques are presented and proposed for reuse in other Rest
applications to ease the support for multiple alternative Media types. Among
these techniques are Dependency Injection to prepare resource method parameters
(\autoref{sec:prep-requ-comp}), Resource Facades
  (\autoref{sec:resourcefacades}), a programmable dispatcher
  (\autoref{sec:dispatcher}).

\subsection{Definitions}

Kolab is the name of a software product ... TODO

A couple of related terms and concepts exist that all more or less overlap with
the functionality provided by Kolab: Groupware, Personal Information
Management/Manager (PIM), Group Information Management (GIM), Computer-supported
cooperative/collaborative work, Knowledge management, (Enterprise) Content
Management.

TODO: keinen der Terme benutzen.

\subsection{Related work}
\subsubsection{IMAP used by Kolab}

Kolab uses an IMAP server as the data store and
synchronization protocol for calendar and contact informations. I want to
compare this approach to a restful one.

Advantages of IMAP:
\begin{itemize}
\item already there, since Mail uses it
\item can store blobs/files so no need to map the iCal/vCard files to a relational scheme
\item out of the box support for offline work and later synchronization (How does it solve editing conflicts?)
\end{itemize}
Disadvantages of IMAP:
\begin{itemize}
\item Complicate, 38 RFCs according to \url{http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol} see also: \url{http://www.apps.ietf.org/rfc/ipoplist.html}
\item All clients directly access the iCal/vCard files with no moderation layer in between. This means that no validation or normalization can be done. Schema updates can only be done if all clients cooperate.
\item IMAP imposes a folder structure. Google's gmail is an example for another, tag based approach. Messages could have several tags. It is therefor hard to access Gmail via IMAP.
\item Sam Varshavchik, the author of the courier Mail Transfer Agent explains the history of IMAP and claims that the IMAP standard is broken: http://www.courier-mta.org/fud/
\item IMAP is so complicate that the IMAP wiki holds 10 pages of advises for IMAP client authors: http://www.imapwiki.org/ClientImplementation RFC 2683 ``IMAP4 Implementation Recommendations'' is a 23 pages document (cut 5 pages for verbosity) explaining how to implement another RFC standard. Is there any widely used standard that needs another RFC explaining how to implement it?

\subsubsection{WebDAV, CalDAV, CardDAV}

\begin{quote}
Were I to propose CalDAV today it would probably be CalAtom  
\end{quote}
-- Lisa Dusseault, February 29, 2008\footnote{\citeurl{http://nih.blogspot.com/2008/02/nearly-two-years-ago-i-made-prediction.html}{2012-1-6}}

\begin{quote}
  I gave a big sigh of relief when I read that, and I hope that the CardDAV
  folks take this to heart. Some parts of WebDAV (e.g., properties [\ldots])
  deserve to be taken out back and shot -- although, as Lisa says, they were
  necessary because of the state of the art at the time. That doesn't mean we
  can't do better now.
\end{quote}
-- Ted Leung, March 6, 2008\footnote{\citeurl{http://www.sauria.com/blog/2008/03/06/google-contacts-and-carddav/}{2012-1-6}}


Roy Fielding says WebDAV is not restful: \url{http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/5874}

\begin{quotation}
PROP* methods conflict with REST because they prevent
important resources from having URIs and effectively double the
number of methods for no good reason. Both Henrik and I argued
against those methods at the time. It really doesn't matter
how uniform they are because they break other aspects of the
overall model, leading to further complications in versioning
(WebDAV versioning is hopelessly complicated), access control
(WebDAV ACLs are completely wrong for HTTP), and just about every
other extension to WebDAV that has been proposed.

[\ldots]

The problem with MOVE is that it is actually an operation on two
independent namespaces (the source collection and destination
collection). The user must have permission to remove from the
source collection and add to the destination collection, which
can be a bit of a problem if they are in different authentication
realms. COPY has a similar problem, but at least in that case
only one namespace is modified. I don't think either of them map
very well to HTTP.
\end{quotation}

The discussion also continued on the microformats mailing list
\url{http://microformats.org/discuss/mail/microformats-rest/2006-April/thread.html#217}.

see \cite{Amundsen2010} for a restful approach to properties.

Is ATOM an alternative to WebDAV?

\begin{quote}
  AtomPub is different from DAV in two key respects:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The client doesn't control where things go, the server does
  \item It is allowed and expected that an AtomPub server will look at the incoming information and change it (generate ID, timestamps, sanitize HTML, etc)
  \end{itemize}
\end{quote}
Tim Bray, http://www.imc.org/atom-protocol/mail-archive/msg11271.html

\subsubsection{OpenSocial}
\label{sec:opensocial}

Roy Fielding wrote a blog post about the ``SocialSite REST API'', stating that
it isn't restful at all but clearly an RPC style
API.\footnote{\citeurl{http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hyperhtext-driven}{2011-12-06}}
Fielding was referring to SocialSite, which is however an implementation of the
OpenSocial specification. Dave Johnson, a contributor to SocialSite, reacted on
this critique by opening a discussion on an OpenSocial mailing
list:\footnote{\citeurl{http://groups.google.com/group/opensocial-and-gadgets-spec/browse_thread/thread/aff4ba7373e21284/201a413efa67c26e}{2011-12-06}}
\begin{quote}
  I must admit, it is not clear to me how OpenSocial REST API violates the six
  rules that Roy stated.
\end{quote}
The above quote warrants a short comment. I also thought before, that REST would
be so simple that there wouldn't be much need for further studying. Every web
developer has some understanding of URIs, HTTP and a bit less of Hypermedia. So
it is easy to fall into the trap that everything build on top of HTTP would be
restful. Now however, after some more reading about REST, I can easily find
violations of the REST constraints in the OpenSocial specification.

Restful APIs are modeled around resources, their representations and links
between them. The authors of the OpenSocial API however seem to have modeled
their API around the concept of services:\cite[Social API Server, sec 2, Services]{OSSpec2.0.1}
\begin{quote}
  OpenSocial defines several services for providing access to a container's data.
\end{quote}

\paragraph{Fielding's critique}
Fielding listed some rules that a restful API must obey, but did not give
explicit examples how OpenSocial violates this rules. The following section will
provide such examples.

\begin{quote}
  A REST API should not be dependent on any single communication protocol,
  [\ldots] any protocol element that uses a URI for identification must allow
  any URI scheme to be used for the sake of that identification.
  \textit{[Failure here implies that identification is not separated from
    interaction.]}
\end{quote}

OpenSocial defines a construct called ``REST-URI-Fragment'' which is a clear
violation of the above rule. This URI fragment is simply an encoding of
procedural parameters as elements of an HTTP URI:\cite[Core API Server, sec
2.1.1.2.2, REST-URI-Fragment]{OSSpec2.0.1}

\begin{quote}
  Each service type defines an associated partial URI format. The base URI for
  each service is found in the URI element associated with the service in the
  discovery document. Each service type accepts parameters via the URL
  path. Definitions are of the form:
  
  \verb:{a}/{b}/{c}:
\end{quote}

URIs can contain a query component that would be more appropriate to contain
parameters. This would also have made it clearer to see that the specification
actually defines services instead of resources. One test showing the misfit is
to ask how dot-segments ('.' and '..') inside the URI fragment are interpreted
and whether this conforms with the letter and spirit of the URI
standard.\cite[sec 3.3]{RFC3986} Another misfit can be seen in the URI fragment
to retrieve one or multiple albums. In this case the 'c' part in the quoted
definition above is actually a list of albums to retrieve separated by a slash.

Fielding's second bullet point most likely refers to the
\texttt{X-HTTP-Method-Override} header. This header is a widely
used\footnote{\citeurl{http://www.subbu.org/blog/2008/07/another-rest-anti-pattern}{2011-12-06}}
workaround to allow the use of other HTTP methods than GET and POST from HTML
forms or through firewalls.

The next two points again refer to a more serious issue:

\begin{quote}
  A REST API should spend almost all of its descriptive effort in defining the
  media type(s) used for representing resources and driving application
  state[\ldots].  \textit{[Failure here implies that out-of-band information is
    driving interaction instead of hypertext.]}  A REST API must not define
  fixed resource names or hierarchies[\ldots] \textit{[Failure here implies that
    clients are assuming a resource structure due to out-of band
    information[\ldots]].}
\end{quote}

The OpenSocial specification contains a lot of out-of-band information
describing how to form URIs to access information or which methods to use on
which URIs for different actions. This means that the OpenSocial API is not
simple or intuitive to use but requires a client developer to read a lot of
specification, thus violating the simplicity property of a restful
architecture. Since the URIs are fixed in the specification and necessarily also
in clients, the modifiability property is also violated.\cite[sec
2.3]{Fielding2000}

The following tables give some examples of the specified URIs:

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{p{6.5cm} l p{10cm}}
  URI fragment & Method & Description \\
  %\hline
  \verb:/people/{User-Id}/@self: & GET & profile for User-Id \\
  \verb:/people/{User-Id}/@self: & DELETE & remove User \\
  \verb:/people/{User-Id}/{Group-Id}: & GET & full profiles of group members \\
  \verb:: & POST & Create relationship, target specified \newline by \verb:<entry><id>: in body \\
   & POST & Update Person \\
  \verb:/people/{Initial-User-Id}/: \newline \verb:{Group-Id}/{Related-User-Id}: & GET & ??? \\
  \verb:/people/@supportedFields: & GET & list of supported person profile fields \\
  \verb:/groups/{User-Id}[/{Group-Id}]: & GET & one or all groups of a user \\
   & PUT & update group \\
   & DELETE & delete group \\
  \verb:/groups/{User-Id}: & POST & create group \\
\end{tabular}
  \caption{URI fragments for peoples and groups in the OpenSocial REST API}
\end{table}

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{p{9.5cm} l p{8cm}}
  URI fragment & Method & Description \\
  %\hline
  \verb:/albums/{User-Id}/@self: & POST & create album \\
  \verb:/albums/{User-Id}/{Group-Id}[/Album-Id]*: & GET & one or multiple albums \\
  \verb:/mediaItems/{User-Id}/{Group-Id}/{Album-Id}/: \newline \verb:{MediaItem-Id}: & GET & one mediaitem \\
  \verb:/mediaItem/{User-Id}/@self/{Album-Id}: (sic!) & POST & create mediaitem \\
\end{tabular}
  \caption{URI fragments for albums and mediaitems in the OpenSocial REST API}
  \label{tab:OSURIAlbums}
\end{table}

The last URI in \autoref{tab:OSURIAlbums} is obviously missing an ``s'' behind
\texttt{mediaItem}. This typo is present and unfixed in the OpenSocial spec
since Version 1.0, released in march 2010. This is of course not a big issue in
itself, but rather a sign that the specification is too verbose and does
over-specify things that should rather be auto-discovered through hyperlinks.

Fielding mentions in a comment to the same blog post that the OpenSocial API
``could be made so [restful] with some relatively small changes'' but does not
specify these changes. However some issues can easily be identified.

First the data structures defined in OpenSocial do not use URIs to refer to
other resources. Instead they use Object-Ids that must then be inserted in the
appropriate URI templates. Examples are the \texttt{recipients},
\texttt{senderId}, \texttt{collectionIds} of messages and the \texttt{ownerId}
of albums. The person structure does not contain fields referencing other
resources. Thus it does not obviously violate REST like the albums and
messages. However it does so even worse since there are hidden references only
defined out-of-band in the specification. One can retrieve the albums, relations
or messages of a user by filling in the \texttt{userId} in one of the specified
URI templates. If Users would just contain references to other resources related
to a user, the specification could already be shortened a lot.

Another missed opportunity for a much more intuitive API is the relation of
media items and albums. This seems to be poster child example for a collection
(album) to collection-element (media item) relation which could have made use of
the hierarchical character of URI paths. OpenSocial however requires the client
developer to use two different URI templates. (\autoref{tab:OSURIAlbums})

A not so small change to OpenSocial would be to either use already standardized
and registered media types where possible or to register new types where
necessary. It seems that there are some already existing media types that could
be a good fit for OpenSocial but only miss a canonical json representation for
easy consumption by javascript applications. These are vCard for
persons,\footnote{OpenSocial persons are based on portable contacts which in
  turn borrowed field names from vCards.} ATOM entries\cite{RFC4287} for
messages, activities and media items and ATOM categories, collections or
workspaces\cite{RFC5023} for albums and groups. It would probably be necessary
to add extensions to the mentioned media types but vCard and ATOM both already
anticipated this need and provided mechanisms to do so.

The use of the ATOM format could promote the adoption of OpenSocial because
developers could either reuse existing knowledge about ATOM or would be more
motivated to learn about a system that is based on an already widespread
format. In fact OpenSocial already mentions ATOM as a way to wrap OpenSocial
data. However this wrapping does not build extend and reuse ATOM semantics as
proposed above but just puts the OpenSocial data structures inside the
entry/content element of ATOM. This kind of misuse of ATOM does of course not
deliver any advantage on top of the existing plain JSON or XML
representations.\footnote{compare Bill de Hora, Extensions v Envelopes. 11/2009 
%\newline
  \citeurl{http://www.dehora.net/journal/2009/11/28/extensions-v-envelopes}{2011-21-07}}
Consequently the newest OpenSocial specification deprecates any reference to the
ATOM format.

In Algermissen's classification (~\ref{sec:algerm-class-http}), the OpenSocial
REST API would actually be ``HTTP-based Type I'' due to the lack of media types
and direct hyper links between related resources. Algermissen writes that this
level has the lowest possible initial cost of all HTTP APIs. Or in other words:
The OpenSocial specification authors did not have to invest a lot to come up
with this API specification but maintenance and evolution cost may be medium or
high.

\subsubsection{CAP}

RFC 4324 "Calendar Access Protocol (CAP)"

\begin{quotation}
  [\ldots] CAP failed because most of the active implementors at the 
time felt it had become too complex to implement - partly because it 
required implementing a "brand new" protocol (BEEP). The upshot of that was 
the CalDAV effort, which was based on an existing fairly well understood 
protocol - WebDAV. One of the benefits of using WebDAV was that it was easy 
to take "off the shelf" WebDAV software (server and client) and get a basic 
CalDAV implementation done very quickly. Indeed, several months after 
CalDAV was published, CalConnect held an interop event at which several 
server and client implementations were present and demonstrated basic 
interoperability - something that would have been hard to achieve with CAP.
\end{quotation}

\section{Requirements}


% SRS template from http://code.google.com/p/e-bibliophile/wiki/SRS
\subsection{Scope}
% This subsection should
% a)Identify the software product(s) to be produced by name (e.g., Host DBMS, 
% Report Generator, etc.);
% b)Explain what the software product(s) will, and, if necessary, will not do;
% c)Describe the application of the software being specified, including relevant 
% benefits, objectives, and goals;
% d)Be consistent with similar statements in higher level specifications 
% (e.g., the system requirements specification), if they exist.

This work defines a protocol to share 


\subsection{General Requirements}
% This subsection of the SRS should provide a summary of the major functions 
% that the software will perform. For example, an SRS for an accounting program 
% may use this part to address customer account maintenance, customer statement, 
% and invoice preparation without mentioning the vast amount of detail that each

% that allocates particular functions to the software product. Note that for the 
% sake of clarity
% a)The functions should be organized in a way that makes the list of functions

\end{itemize}

% restful: one entry point, reuse of existing protocols and media types
% easy to understand and implement
% Collections z.B. für Projekte könnten alle möglichen Typen konsumieren.

\paragraph{Replacement for CardDAV}

The web application should provide at least the same features as the CardDAV
protocol. It should be demonstrated that a restful application can serve for the
same purpose and thus that the additional complexity of WebDAV and CardDAV is
not necessary.

The standard lists the supposed main features of CardDAV\cite[sec. 1]{RFC6352}:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Ability to use multiple address books with hierarchical layout.
\item Ability to control access to individual address books and address entries
  as per WebDAV Access Control List (ACL) [RFC3744].
\item Principal collections can be used to enumerate and query other users on
  the system as per WebDAV ACL [RFC3744].
\item Server-side searching of address data, avoiding the need for clients to
  download an entire address book in order to do a quick address 'expansion'
  operation.
\item Well-defined internationalization support through WebDAV's use of XML.
\item Use of vCards [RFC2426] for well-defined address schema to enhance client
  interoperability.
\item Many limited clients (e.g., mobile devices) contain an HTTP stack that
  makes implementing WebDAV much easier than other protocols.
\end{enumerate}

There are some minor features of CardDAV, that are mainly inherited from WebDAV
and whose general usefulness outside of the scope of a content management system
could be argued. See \autoref{sec:excluded-requirements} for a discussion of
those.

\paragraph{Restful}
The application should obey the constraints of a rest application as specified
in \cite{Fielding2000}.

TODO: 4 Grundconstraints von REST auflisten.

The above constraints are not an end in itself but lead to the following
required or desirable properties:

\begin{itemize}
\item Cacheability (5.1.4) can keep the data available also in offline mode, improves performance and scalability.
\item Simplicity helps to develop glue code to connect the application to other systems or to extend it.
\item Modifiability allows to adapt the Groupware to changes in the organization.
\item Reliability should not need additional justification.
\item Administrative scalability means that intermediary components can be deployed independent of the administrator of the main application.
\end{itemize}

Other outcomes described by Fielding that may not be of importance for the
present work are: scalability in terms of users, network performance and
efficiency.



\subsection{User Classes and Characteristics}

TODO: plain Web Browsers, Desktop applications (PIM Suites), JavaScript Gadgets/Widgets (see OpenSocial) probably with WebStorage\footnote{\citeurl{http://www.w3.org/TR/webstorage/}{2012-2-2}}

Aus den verschiedenen Benutzerern leitet sich ab, dass verschiedene Medientypen unterstützt werden sollen: xCard, JSON, HTML

\subsection{Operation Environment}

The application is expected to be installed in a Java servlet container like
Tomcat or Jetty and to contact a separate storage component. The primarily
targeted storage component is an IMAP server with a Kolab conform set of
groupware folders. However the design should not restrict the extension to a
document database like CouchDB, plain files, relational or XML databases.

\subsection{Design and Implementation Constraints}

\subsection{Specific Requirements}

\paragraph{Nested and mixed collections}
The design should not unnecessarily hinder that collections could be nested or
contain different kinds of media types, e.g. calendar items and contacts. 

\cite[sec. 5.2]{RFC6352} forbids nested and mixed collections to ease the
implementation of clients. However both may make sense in certain scenarios and
the protocol should not exclude such scenarios. A collection could for example
represent all items related to a project, which include contacts, events, todos
and notes.

\subsection{Excluded requirements}
\label{sec:excluded-requirements}
\paragraph{Search}
It is not required that the server implements any means to search its data. It
is not excluded that such a facility could be added later. It is however
expected that searching could be implemented separately. This could be done
either on a synchronizing client or as a separate system in the same
administrative domain as the server.

\paragraph{Performance optimization}
The system is meant to inherit the benefits of a restful architecture. It should
therefor be possible to attach separate caching intermediaries for read
requests. Rather then concentrating on the performance of the implementation of
read requests it should be taken care that the architecture supports external
caching and thus avoids to serve the same read request multiple times.

\paragraph{Access Control}
The aspect of access control would broaden the scope of this work to
wide. However it could be kept in mind, whether the proposed design could be
enhanced by a separate access control design as proposed in
\cite{conf/rest/GrafZLW11}.

\paragraph{Copying and Moving}
WebDAV introduces the HTTP verbs to COPY and MOVE. The usefulness of such
functionality must of course be compared to the complexity of the implementation
and the drawback of incompatibility to plain HTTP.

It is possible to enhance a restful API with copy and move functionality without
extending HTTP. The only requirement is that additional hyperlinks can be
attached to the resources of the API. Allamaraju \cite[Ch. 11]{Allamaraju_2010} proposes
``controller resources'' that act on POST requests and are linked from the
resources they act on. Custom link relations are used to indicate the semantic
of the controller resource.

This work does not include initial support for copy or move.

\paragraph{Versioning}
WebDAV and therefor CalDAV and CardDAV support the versioning of resources as an
extension to the HTTP protocol. Versioning is an important feature for a text
authoring system that may have been the main target for the WebDAV protocol.  It
does however seem to be of little use for the resources considered here. The
resources are mostly created in one session by one user and seldom modified.

\paragraph{Make Collections}
WebDAV introduces the MKCOL HTTP verb to create collections. CardDAV recommends
that implementations support this to allow users to ``organize their data
better''. An alternative would be to make use of ATOM categories for
grouping. Instead of creating a new (empty) collection the user would thus
create a contact resource with a new category. An ATOM service document could
then link to a new (virtual) collection that only contains and accepts resources
of this category.

TODO: What are the proposed ways to create collections?
Post a feed to the service document? Put a new service document? Put a feed document to the desired location?

\paragraph{Locking}
As with Versioning, this is feature of WebDAV is not considered. Instead of
locking a resource HTTP supports conditional updates and leaves conflict
resolution to the client.

\paragraph{Push notifications}
This work does not include any means to actively notify (push) a client about
changes happening on the server. The client needs to initiate a request (pull)
to the server to look for changes. However separate solutions exist\footnote{most
  notable PubSubHubBub

\begin{quote}
  To some extent, people get REST wrong because I failed to include enough
  detail on media type design within my dissertation.~--~Roy T. Fielding
\end{quote}
from: Rest APIs must be hypertext driven\footnote
  {\citeurl{http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven}{2011-12-20}}

\cite[sec. 7.2]{Pautasso:2008:RWS:1367497.1367606} identifies the support of different media types as an issue that "can complicate and hinder the interoperability" and "requires more maintenance effort".

\cite{Davis:2011:XTR:1967428.1967437} proposes a XML based REST framework that uses XForms, XQuery, XProc, XSLT and an XML database. It can benefit from the constraint that it only supports XML based media types. It is to be seen, which ideas from this work could be reused in the case of a broader variety of supported media types.

\subsection{Syntax vs. Semantic (Vocabulary)}

The usage of standardized media types is one key difference between an API and a
restful API. \cite[sec. 5.2.1.2]{Fielding2000} Only if the client has knowledge
about the media type can it do something meaningful with it besides just
receiving it. In that sense, the often used mime types application/xml or
application/json are not really media types. They don't tell the browser or user
anything meaningful beside the \emph{syntax} of the data.\footnote{
\citeurl{http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/11/18/rest-api-design-putting-the-type-in-content-type}{2011-21-20}
and Web Resource Modeling Language \citeurl{http://www.wrml.org}{2011-12-20} both by Mark Massé
}

To do anything meaningful with plain json or xml, the client programmer must
normally look up the meaning or \emph{semantic} of the data in the API
documentation. The data therefor fails the self-descriptive constraint of
REST.

Compare this with a mime type like \texttt{application/atom+xml}. It specifies
the syntax (xml) and the semantic (atom) of the data. Of course somebody once
needed to read the atom specification and program the client with the knowledge
of how to process this media type. The purpose of standardized media types
however is that there is a limited number of them and that they are reused by many
sites and clients.

Large sites like Google, Facebook or Twitter can successfully attract enough
developers to read their specifications and program clients accordingly. Usually
one can also find client libraries that can help a lot. REST however envisions a
decentralized web in which parties can interact without previous knowledge of
each other. This becomes possible through the usage of well known predefined
media types.

\subsection{Data Models of Media Types}

TODO:
\begin{itemize}
\item Ein generelles Daten Modell wäre hilfreich, um alle Medien Typen darauf zu projezieren und mit einer solchen Projektion dann innerhalb der Applikation zu arbeiten (TODO Schreier: warum muss dass Datenmodell total allgemeingültig sein, reicht es nicht vielleicht auch für eine Domäne?)
\item Ein allgemeines Datenmodell könnte auch eine Hilfe sein als Zwischenschritt für Conversions zwischen Medientypen
\item Es gibt kein allgemeines, sinnvolles Datenmodell für alle Medientypen
\item Trotzdem können bestimmte hilfreiche Generalisierungen vorgenommen werden
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Die meisten Resourcen haben bestimmte generische Metadaten die entweder im Medientyp kodiert werden können oder mit dem Medientyp zusammen persistiert werden müssen
  \item Diese Metadaten finden sich auch in atom:entry wieder und sind: Autor, Updated, Titel, Summary, etag, id, name, links
  \item Transitional Links vs Structural Links: \url{http://java.net/projects/jax-rs-spec/pages/Hypermedia}
  \item Different categories of data: CSV, binary/plain text, large binary (video), tree (XML/JSON) (Referenz?)


  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{XML vs. JSON}

% Data Meta Models http://dret.net/netdret/docs/wilde-cacm2008-document-design-matters/

This section investigates the two most common syntaxes used by media types
and the issues that arise if an application needs to support both of them.

The application section of the IANA mime type registration has 294 entries
ending in ``+xml'' and only 3 ending in
``+json''.\footnote{\citeurl{http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/index.html}{2011-12-20}}
This stands in contrast to the rise of public JSON APIs and the decline of XML
APIs.\footnote{\citeurl{http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/05/25/1-in-5-apis-say-bye-xml/}{2011-12-20} \citeurl{http://www.readwriteweb.com/cloud/2011/03/programmable-web-apis-popping.php}{2011-12-21}}

%Web developers often prefer JSON over XML because it is perceived as easier to
%parse, process and smaller in size. XML in comparison is seen as complicate,
%slow to process and larger in size. - keine Quellen
A strong argument for JSON as the preferred format for public APIs may be that
JSON is a subset of JavaScript and thus easily consumable in a web
browser.\footnote{ECMAScript for XML (E4X) makes XML a first class language
  construct in the browser but is only supported by Mozilla
  \citeurl{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript_for_XML}{2012-2-2}}

A drawback of this mismatch between the preference of media type designers and
API consumers is a possible duplication of work and incompatibilities across
different APIs. An author that wants to offer a public API as JSON is likely to
find only an existing XML media type, but no one in JSON.  The situation would
be eased, if a standard mapping from XML schemes to JSON would be possible, but
that is not the case.

Instead, possible mappings have to trade of the preservation of all structural
information against the ``friendliness'' of the resulting JSON
structure.\cite{Boyer2011} Without going into detail, a JSON structure can be
seen as friendly if it makes best use of JSON's data types, is compact and easy
to process. \autoref{fig:waysmapxmljson} shows two different examples how to map
data from XML to JSON with one of them using JSON number values, being more
compact and probably easier to process.

Activity Streams has avoided the misalignment of an official XML format and an unofficial JSON deviate by defining an XML (ATOM) and JSON format from the beginning.\footnote{\citeurl{http://activitystrea.ms/}{2012-01-21}}

Version 3 of vCard was published in 1998\cite{RFC2425} only a few months after
the W3C published Version 1.0 of XML\cite{Paoli:98:XR} and eight years before
JSON became an official standard.\cite{RFC4627}

  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{Hypermedia support in xCard and xCal}
\end{figure}

The iCalendar standard defines a several properties that can link to external
representations of the properties value by specifying an ``Alternate Text
Representation'' parameter. These are comment, summary, description, contact,
location, resources. The properties attendee and organizer can have a
``Directory Entry Reference'' parameter that should contain an URI to a person
resource. One property that can not be dereferenced is ``Related To'': It only
contains the globally unique identifier of another calendar component.

One problem that arises with the use of hyperlinks in personal information
management is identification across administrative boundaries. Take for example
an event that gets sent from one organization to another and contains hyperlinks
to person representations. These hyperlinks most likely point to an internal
addressbook of the organization and may not be accessible by the receiver of the
event information. The receiver however may have his own addressbook containing
information about the person.

\subsection{Microformats, Microdata, RDFa}
\label{sec:microdata}

HTML documents are primarily meant to be rendered by browsers and interpreted by
humans. It is hard for a computer to interpret the meaning of text and data
included in an HTML document. Microformats, Microdata and RDFa define ways to
add additional meta data to HTML that allows computers to identify structured
data in HTML without having an impact on the rendering.\cite{Tennison2012}

There is not yet an established term to refer to the three different
formats. Practitioners use ``structured data
languages''\footnote{\citeurl{http://manu.sporny.org/2011/uber-comparison-rdfa-md-uf/}{2012-2-20}},
``machine-readable data format''\cite{Hickson2011}, ``structured data
markup''\footnote{\citeurl{http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2011/06/introducing-schemaorg-search-engines.html}{2012-2-20}}
or just ``structured markup''. Scientific publications seem to use the term
``Semantic annotation''\cite{instance7} to refer to HTML with machine readable
semantic data. This work will use the term ``Semantic annotation format'' to
refer to Microformats, Microdata, RDFa and similar formats.

\subsubsection{Use Cases}

One major use case for semantic annotations is to help search engines to better
index the annotated site. The Microformats project was started by a blog search
engine
(Technorati)\footnote{\citeurl{http://tantek.com/log/2006/05.html}{2012-2-20}}
and the recent schema.org effort came from the three big search engines Google,
Bing and Yahoo. Another use case is demonstrated by the Firefox plugin
``Operator''.\footnote{\citeurl{https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/operator/}{2012-2-20}}
It allows to extract annotated entities from web pages. A user could thus import
contact or event data from arbitrary web pages in his personal information
manager with one click. Semantic annotations can also be used to make web
content accessible to disabled people.\cite{Yesilada:2007:EDS:1279700.1279704}

In the context of this work, Semantic annotations could be used inside the
\lstinline:summary: tag of Atom entries. A consumer of a feed of contact
elements could thus use the data extracted from the annotated summary data to
provide a tabular overview of the entries even without fetching the associated
media resource of the entry.

TODO example

A third use case is currently under development as part of the European Union
Research Project ``Interactive Knowledge Stack'' (IKS) that builds a semantic
content management stack. The sub-project ``Vienna IKS Editables''
(VIE)\footnote{\citeurl{http://www.iks-project.eu/projects/vienna-iks-editables}{2012-2-20}}
uses semantic annotations to make content on a web site editable. In a
traditional content management system, content is editable via HTML forms that
are available as separate sites in addition to the normal view.  The VIE
Javascript library instead searches the HTML document for semantically annotated
entities and dynamically builds editing interfaces for those. A modified entity
can then be sent to the server via AJAX in a format called ``json-ld'' that
serializes semantic data to
JSON.\footnote{\citeurl{http://json-ld.org}{2012-2-20} the iana registration of
  the mime type \lstinline:application/ld+json: is currently discussed}

\subsubsection{Format selection}

With at least three different formats, a developer needs to settle on one to
implement.\footnote{It is possible to implement multiple formats in
  parallel.\cite{Tennison2012}} A first consideration has to be the ability of
expected consumers to handle the format, a second consideration the available
tooling to produce a particular format. The different Semantic annotation formats
impose certain requirements for the used HTML dialect. Microformats can be used
with all versions of HTML, RDFa with XHTML or HTML5 and Microdata introduces
special attributes that work only with HTML5.\cite{Tennison2012}

Microdata is part of HTML5 and a standard effort of the W3C.\cite{Hickson2011}
It is also backed up by the schema.org effort of Google and
Microsoft.\footnote{\citeurl{http://schema.org/docs/gs.html\#microdata_why}{2012-2-17}}
The schema.org vocabulary in turn has been mapped to the semantic world by
researchers working on linked
data.\footnote{\citeurl{http://schema.rdfs.org/about.html}{2012-2-17}} Thus by
using Microdata with the schema.org vocabulary, the data can easily be combined
with other semantic data. The rest of this work therefor concentrates on
Microdata. Many good arguments to also consider RDFa can be found in the blog of
Manu
Sporny\footnote{\citeurl{http://manu.sporny.org/category/rdfa/}{2012-2-20}},
chair of the RDF Web Applications Working Group at the World Wide Web
Consortium.

\subsubsection{Producing Semantically annotated HTML}

A recent discussion of possibilities to produce semantically annotated HTML
pages can be found in \cite[sec. 9.1.3]{DBLP:books/daglib/0023755}. The authors ``discern
two different ways in which the Semantic Web plays a key role in current Web
engineering approaches: one is by the creation of Web applications starting from
semantically described data, and the second is by the generation of semantic
annotations from the Web engineering process.''

In the case of this work only the second way is of interest, since we don't
assume the data to be persisted in a semantic model and aim to generate semantic
annotations. As an example for this way the book describes a method developed as
part of a larger ``Web Semantics Design Method'' (WSDM).  This method consists
of two mappings. The first one is the ``data source mapping (DSM), which
describes exactly how the reference ontology maps to the actual data source.''
The second mapping uses XPointer expressions to link HTML tags to elements of
the reference ontology from the first mapping. Neither the book nor referenced
papers however go in any more detail about the final step of generating the
annotated HTML tags.

One important point can be learned from the WSDM description. The production of
semantically annotated HTML can become a lot easier if the entity is already
available represented with the targeted vocabulary. A very naive approach to
produce annotated HTML would be to just manually write the necessary attributes
in the template and fill them with values from an arbitrary data object, as
demonstrated in listing \ref{fig:naive-microdata-template}. Even with the
conciseness of the used template language
Jade\footnote{\citeurl{http://scalate.fusesource.org/documentation/jade-syntax.html}{2012-2-22}
  Jade is the most concise among several supported template languages of the
  Scalate Template Engine.}, the developer still has a lot to type.

\begin{anylisting}[label=fig:naive-microdata-template,
                   caption={Defining all Microdata attributes manually in an HTML template}]
-@ var vcard: VCard

div( itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person" 
     itemid=#{vcard.getProperty("uid")} )
  span( itemprop="name" )
    #{vcard.getProperty("fn")}
  span( itemprop="telephone" ) 
    #{vcard.getProperty("tel")}
\end{anylisting}

Compared to the above listing \ref{fig:microdata-template} shows a template
using a data structure that is aware of the used Microdata vocabulary and wraps
an instance of a typed Microdata item with its properties. The
\lstinline:scope: method of the Microdata interface will add the
\lstinline:itemscope:, \lstinline:itemtype: and \lstinline:itemid: attributes to
the nested \lstinline:div: element. The \lstinline:prop: method either augments
a nested element as shown for the \lstinline:name: property or creates the
correct nested element. The method adds the \lstinline:itemprop: attribute and
puts the value for this property inside the element.

\begin{anylisting}[label=fig:microdata-template,
                   caption={Using a Microdata-aware data structure in a template}]
-@ var md: MicroData

= md.scope
  div
    = md.prop("name")
      span( style="color:red" )
    = md.prop("telephone")
    = md.prop("email")
\end{anylisting}

An implementation of this approach must take care of a few
peculiarities.\cite{Hickson2011} Some properties don't necessarily use simple
\lstinline:span: elements, e.g. dates can be better expressed with
\lstinline:time: elements or URI values most likely appear in an
\lstinline:a:,\lstinline:img:,\lstinline:link: or \lstinline:object:
element. Property values could also be put in a \lstinline:content: attribute
while the element's nested text content is optimized for human
consumption. Items can be nested, e.g. an item of type PostalAddress could be
nested inside a Person item.

A template engine that should be extended as described above should allow to
capture and manipulate nested HTML elements and to call methods of passed in
objects.

Some problems in loss-less conversion of ATOM to json:\cite{Snell2008}
\begin{itemize}
  \item JSON has no equivalent for the xml:lang attribute.
  \item Dereferencable IRIs must be transformed to URIs.
  \item URIs relative to an xml:base attribute must be resolved, also inside XHTML content elements.
  \item Repeatable elements must be converted to arrays.
  \item The ATOM date format (RFC 3339) differs from the JavaScript Date serialization.
  \item ATOM content elements are versatile but should be represented more meaningful in JSON then just a plain String.
  \item ATOM supports arbitrary extensions via namespaces.

\section{Design}

% The design must not support any possible use case but only restful web applications.

% The life cycle of ResourceHandlers is for the application. They receive the called URL as part of the request context as a method parameter.
% ResourceHandlers could be wired together at run time, instantiated with a set of handler functors which could carry their storage in their closure.
% Specifying the media types handled by a handler function as annotations is verbose. If I have a method that handles contacts, I need to specify several media types. If a method handler can handle Contacts, Events and Todos, I need to repeat a lot of media types.

% Handler functors return a tuppel of status code, headers set and response body.
% Alternatively they can return early by throwing a special exception carrying a status code and a message.
% Exceptions thrown from a ResourceHandler should be serialized in a way easily to consume for the client.

% Concerns: Authorization, Logging, Trigger Message (to indexing system, subscribers), Measure execution time, Support Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)\footnote{\citeurl{http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/}{2012-2-2}}, Compression

% The life cycle of a CollectionStorage is across individual requests to facilitate caching or database connection reuse.

\subsection{Overview}

\subsection{Reusable Patterns and Components}

Reuse is of course in general a good thing. In the context of Model Driven
Development (MDD) and code generation it is especially import to identify code
that is general enough to be provided by a library of framework and does not
need to be generated.

Minimizing the generated code also minimizes the extend of drawbacks associated
with code generation, most importantly conflicts between updates by the code
generator and manual modification.


% We have a namespace at our disposal. HTTP suggests to interpret the path component of this namespace in a hierarchic way.
% The URI must be mapped to a resource, independent of the requested media type or HTTP verb. 
% It therefor makes sense to do the interpretation of the URI or the path independent from Media type or HTTP verb dispatch.

% wilde-fqas argues that feeds (collections) provide a general enough abstraction 

Concerns regarding Media Types that needs to be implemented differently for each different Media Type:
\begin{itemize}
\item validate the Media Type
\item provide accessors to read, write parts of the Media Type
\item serialize, deserialize the whole Media Type
\item converters to other formats
\item accessors to common interfaces (projection), e.g. common generic resource attributes or common attributes of a contact
\end{itemize}
% Attributes of a resource could be virtual or derived, e.g. the size of an image is derived from the binary image data.
% Images also contain additional data that could be exposed as attributes.


Candidate areas for re-usability:
\begin{itemize}
\item link building, URL parsing
\item HTML form building, parsing
\item generic properties of resources, id
\item resource types
\item question to storage: does resource still match ETag? Has changed since?
\item all links of a resource: Link: intern/extern/undefined, href, rel, title, text, media type
\item bool function matchesMediaType(), getMediaType() auf WrappedEntry
\item Prüfung, ob ein Update durchgeführt werden soll, gemäß ETAG, ifnotchanged
\item Möglichkeit, DatenKlassen mit DatenTypen zu definieren wie in eZ Publish um automatische Views und Edit Ansichten zu ermöglichen.
\item Creation of resources: POST to collection with SLUG Header, PUT to URI, normalization of SLUG Header
\item Pagination (building and parsing of next and previous URIs, implementation of RFC5005), querying the collections entries provider with the correct parameters (offset, limit).
\item Storage interface with transaction support. An application may for example need to notify an indexing component after some resource has been changed. -- No transaction support: Every action that must happen in a transaction together with the resource change must be handled by the storage layer, must be aware of the storage technologie.
\end{itemize}

% Im Gegensatz zu Bildern, wie in \cite{Schreier:2011:MRA:1967428.1967434} können Kontakte komplett inline sein.

\subsection{Interactions}
\subsubsection{Discovery of Collections}

An ideal Rest API is accessed by one main URI and all other resources can be
discovered by following links. A useful Media type to discover available
collections is the Atom Service Document.\cite[sec. 8]{RFC5023} It contains
links to collections organized in workspaces and annotated with meta data.

A Groupware client most likely needs to discern the available collections by the
contained resources as to consume and present them with the appropriate user
interfaces for contacts, calendar data, etc. A first idea could be to use the
Media types declared in the ``accept'' tag of a collection to identify types of
collections. However the specification explicitly states that this tag
``specifies a type of representation that can be POSTed to a Collection''. If a
collection can only be read then no accept tag should be present and thus also
not available for interpretation.

\end{anylisting}

A standard conform approach is demonstrated by Google's Data
Protocol\footnote{\citeurl{http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/docs/2.0/elements.html}{2012-2-28}}
and by an internal project at
IBM\footnote{\label{snellatomcategory}\citeurl{http://www.imc.org/atom-syntax/mail-archive/msg18208.html}{2012-2-28}}. Both
use atom categories\cite[sec. 8.3.6]{RFC5023} to mark the type of atom
entries. James Snell proposed a standard URI to identify the semantic of
categories\footref{snellatomcategory} but no follow up to this could be
found. The use of categories to attach arbitrary meaning, e.g ``event type
(product or promotion), and its status (new, updated, or cancelled)'' to feeds
and entries is also recommended in \cite[p. 200]{Webber2010}.

The CalAtom\cite{draft-yates-atompub-calatom-00.txt} proposal introduces a new
tag ``features'' and an associated IANA registry to mark collection types and
their features. But the examples of category usage above and the interaction
patterns outlined in this section provide confidence that a new tag is not
required.

To make categories usable for a common Groupware API, the server needs to use a
categorization scheme understood by the client. If different clients don't agree
on one scheme the server could still support several.\footnote{As a last resort
  a client could of course also fetch the feeds and identify the media types of
  the included media entries.}

An alternative Media Type to Service Documents in JSON could not be found. The
most promising approach seems to list available collections in a
\lstinline:application/vnd.collection+json: representation. (\autoref{sec:media-types-coll})

\paragraph{personalized Service Documents} For a Groupware that manages
confidential information it would make sense to provide personalized Service
Documents for authenticated users that list only collections that the user is
authorized to read.\footnote{For this use case it would be convenient, if HTTP
  would support optional authentication, but it does not or only
  poorly. \citeurl{http://computerstuff.jdarx.info/content/optional-http-authentication}{2012-2-28}}
Personalized Service Documents for different users should have different URIs to
make them cacheable and to acknowledge that each personalized Service Document
is indeed an individual entity. This however conflicts with the previous goal of
using one unique Service Document URI as entrance to the API. A solution would
be to require the user to authenticate when requesting the unique entrance URI
and to answer with a HTTP code ``307 Temporary Redirect'' to the user's
personalized Service Document after successful
authentication.\footnote{Alternative all Service Documents could be served under
  the entrance URI with different HTTP Content-Location
  headers.\cite[sec. 14.14]{RFC2616} In that case the personalized Service
  Document must however also be available at the indicated location.}

\subsubsection{Synchronizing Collections}

An atom feed can be used to synchronize a collection of entries from server to
client. The necessary ingredients that make this possible are the link relation
``next''\cite{RFC5005}, the concept of a ``deleted
entry''\cite{draft-snell-atompub-tombstones-14} and the prerequisite that the
feed entries must ``be ordered by their "app:edited" property, with the most
recently edited Entries coming first in the document
order''\cite[sec. 10]{RFC5023}.

\subsubsection{Modifying Resources}

TODO Atompub requires the client to download the full representation before
editing. This however could be avoided, if the feed would contain etags,
probably as attributes to the link tag.

Google adds an etag attribute to the entry tag in its data api.\footnote{\citeurl{http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/docs/2.0/reference.html\#ResourceVersioning}{2012-2-13}}

\subsubsection{Special Reports, Search}
TODO 
full text search in contacts -> OpenSearch

The client can compare the update time of any entry with the update time of an entry that it may have cached to avoid unnecessary loading.

complete collections \cite{RFC5005} for months, weeks, days, time ranges
 - should not contain full representations but etags

TODO It would be good, if OpenSearch links would already be available in the service document to avoid loading the feed.
TODO Google://opensearch service document

Microdata (\autoref{sec:microdata}) enhanced summaries could be used by the client to display the results list.

OpenSearch already defines an extension to limit a search to a time range.\footnote{\citeurl{http://www.opensearch.org/Specifications/OpenSearch/Extensions/Time/1.0/Draft_1}{2012-2-13}}

\subsubsection{AtomPub for PIM data}

Rob Yates \url{mailto:robert_yates@us.ibm.com}:
CalATOM \citeurl{http://robubu.com/?p=6}{2012-01-05} Draft:
CardATOM \citeurl{http://robubu.com/?p=10}{2012-01-05}

Rob Yates drafted a CalATOM
specification.\cite{draft-yates-atompub-calatom-00.txt} It references another
old draft (draft-snell-atompub-feature-12) to mark a collection as a CalATOM
collection. This seems unnecessary since we can specify that a collection
accepts calendar resources and thus marking a collection as a calendar.

Furthermore the draft mentions a capability to query for events in a given time
range. There is no equivalent for such a request for contacts.

In rest the draft only repeats or references the atompub standard and the xcal
format. This draft could therefor be seen as indication that the existing
standards are almost sufficient to define GroupWare APIs.

Google Data API also uses ATOM, but puts their tags directly inside the ``atom:entry'' tag 
instead of putting all of the content in the content element of an atom
entry.\footnote{\citeurl{http://web.archive.org/web/20081120001246/http://www.snellspace.com/wp/?p=314}{2012-01-05}}

\begin{itemize}
\item Atom entries could contain multiple link tags referring to alternative
  representations of the resource with different (media) type attributes.
\item The synchronization algorithm is so simple that it does not even warrant an activity diagram:
  \begin{quote}
    Consume all entries of a (paged\footnote{RFC 5005 - Feed Paging and
      Archiving}) feed unless you see an entry older then the newest entry from
    your last synchronization run.
  \end{quote}
\item If the content of the entry is presented inline then the client does not
  know the etag of the resource representation? TODO
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Components}

\subsubsection{Dispatcher}
\label{sec:dispatcher}
The dispatcher selects the Java method (see \ref{sec:components-actions}) that
should handle the request. The selection can depend at least on the path
component of the requested URI, the media types accepted by the client as
indicated in the request's ACCEPT header and the HTTP verb.

Every project implementing JAX-RS\cite{JAX-RS1.1} needs to have some kind of
dispatcher component. The specification itself does not identify this
component. It does however specify the algorithm a dispatcher needs to follow
and a set of Java annotations which must be used to configure the
dispatch. These annotations (PATH, GET for the HTTP verb and Produces) are
demonstrated in listing \ref{fig:jaxrs-annotated-resource-example}.

\begin{javalisting}[label=fig:jaxrs-annotated-resource-example,
                   caption={Example of a JAX-RS annotated Resource class (by Marek Potociar)}]
@Path("atm/{cardId}")	
public class AtmResource {	
`  
  @GET 	
  @Path("balance")	
  @Produces("text/plain")	
  public String balance(@PathParam("cardId") String card,	
                        @QueryParam("pin") String pin) {	
    return Double.toString(getBalance(card, pin));	
  }
\end{javalisting}
 
Alternative approaches to configure the dispatcher are not designated by
JAX-RS. One possible alternative would be to expose an API to manually add
dispatch routes at runtime and remove the corresponding annotations from the
source code. 

This approach is indeed implemented e.g. by
Restlet\footnote{\citeurl{http://wiki.restlet.org/docs_2.1/13-restlet/27-restlet/326-restlet.html}{2012-2-6}},
Apache Wink\footnote{called ``Dynamic Resources''
  \citeurl{http://incubator.apache.org/wink/1.1/html/5.1 Registration and
    Configuration.html}{2012-2-7}} and probably others. Jersey 2.0 is also
expected to provide an API for the
dispatcher.\footnote{\citeurl{http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-842}{2012-2-6}}:

Advantages of a dynamic dispatcher configuration would be:

\begin{itemize}
\item The path under which a resource type is served is decoupled from the code
  defining the behavior of the resource. This could enable the reuse of resource
  classes or methods in other contexts.
\item The decision which media types can be consumed or produced may not depend
  solely on the resource class or method. A resource method may work on a domain
  specific data type and the set of supported media types may depend on the
  available converter between media types and the data type. A photo album for example
  resource may be able to consume any number of different image formats that
  a separate component can convert to an internal image representation.
\item The list of supported media types could be created programmatically. This
  enables reuse of set of equivalent media types or combination of media type
  categories for example to combine the sets of image, video and audio media
  types.
\item The concept of resource classes could be replaced altogether. The life
  cycle of a resource class in JAX-RS defaults to the request scope. During one
  request only one resource method is called. Resource methods therefor by
  default don't share state through resource class attributes. It would therefor
  be possible to bind individual functors to dispatcher routes and thus
  composing the equivalent of a resource class at runtime.
\end{itemize}

TODO:

The dispatching as defined in JAX-RS does not define any facility for a resource
method to decline its possibility to handle a method at runtime. Such a facility
could either be implemented by a boolean precondition method associated with the
resource method or by a special Exception type that would restart the request
dispatch but this time ignoring the method that threw the exception. If no
alternative request method could be found, the Exception would be propagated and
subsequently transformed into an appropriate error response.

Thus it would be possible to define generic and special purpose request methods
even for cases where the static JAX-RS dispatch algorithm does not provide
sufficient granularity.

While all this flexibility can provide many advantages it has to be kept in mind
how the framework can gather enough knowledge to still help by autogenerating
e.g. WADL documents and responses to HEAD and OPTION requests.

\subsubsection{Resource Facades}
\label{sec:resourcefacades}
Fielding discerns between a resource and the representation of a resource in a
certain format, ``selected dynamically based on the capabilities or desires of
the recipient and the nature of the resource''.\cite[p. 87]{Fielding2000}
According to this notion, the media type used to represent a resource should not
influence the processing logic. In an ideal case all possible media types should
be handled by the same resource method.

This ideal contrasts with JAX-RS concepts where the media type can be one
parameter of the dispatcher logic. This section outlines a pattern tentatively
named ``Resource Facades'' that should make it easier to handle different media
types with the same code and thus to facilitate code reuse.

A resource method should contain the programming logic executed to serve a
request of a specific type (e.g. GET, PUT) against a specific resource. The
programming logic could execute common tasks like the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item validate the correctness of a submitted resource
\item check the clients authorization
\item persist the submitted resource data
\item trigger notifications containing a summary of the resource
\item submit the submitted resource to an indexing system
\item check the submitted resource to be of a certain accepted domain type, like
  contact, event, todo item or any set of such types
\end{itemize}

All the above processing tasks should in theory be independent of the media type
of a resource and only be programmed once to work on any resource format. This
could be made possible by applying the concept of roles to resources. Roles have
been described already 15 years ago by \cite{Fowler1997} or a bit later by
\cite{Baeumer2000}. However no evidence could be found whether roles have been
used to implement restful systems.

According to \cite{Steimann2008}, there exists several definitions for roles
which mostly share a few core properties:

\begin{quote}
  This includes the property that a single object can play several roles of
  different or the same kind both simultaneously and sequentially, and that the
  same role can be played by different objects of the same and different
  kinds. Raised to the type level, this means that the relationship between role
  types and class types (as sources of role players) is generally m:n.
\end{quote}

A popular example for roles is a person, that can have the different roles over
their lifetime (student, professor, single, husband, widower) or in different
contexts (teacher, father, husband, customer, politician).

% \cite{Steimann2001} repeats the necessity of the dynamic role concept and argues
% that (Java) interfaces serve as an appropriate mean to handle roles.

Exemplified with the above tasks, a resource can have the role of being
validated, persisted, summarized or checked for being of a certain type. So like
in the above quote a facility is needed that can provide m different roles of
resources that come in n different shapes.

It can be noted, that unlike in the previous example with roles of a person,
this resource roles examples do not extend the original resource with new
attributes. A person surely gets additional attributes as a father (references
to children) or professor (member of faculty). Thus the term ``facade'' in favor
of role should indicate that only different views of the same data are provided.

Listing \ref{fig:datafacades-api} shows interfaces of a minimal framework to
provide Facades for Resources. The idea is, that any code that needs information
from a Resource requests the appropriate Facade from the ResourceHandler. The
ResourceHandler was instantiated with a FacadeRegistry from which it can request
Factories for requested Facades. A ResourceHandler must have been instantiated
with at least one initial input Facade, e.g. an InputStream.

\begin{javalisting}[label=fig:datafacades-api,
                    float=p,
                   caption={API of the ResourceFacades component}]
interface FacadeFactory<T> {
 T build(ResourceHandler resourceHandler);

 /**
  * Dependency Facades needed by this factory.
  */
 Iterable<? extends Class<?>> getDependencies();
}

interface FacadeRegistry {
 /**
  * Returns Facade factories that could probably
  * build the requested Facade.
  *
  * @param mediaType MediaType of the original Resource
  * @param clazz requested Facade interface
  */
 Iterable<FacadeFactory<?>> getFacadeFactories(MediaType mediaType,
                                               Class<?> clazz);
}

interface ResourceHandler {
 /**
  * Returns the unique instance of a Facade for this Resource
  *
  * Subsequent calls with the same parameter receive the
  * _same_ unique Facade instance!
  *
  * @param clazz requested Facade interface
  * @return Facade implementation instance
  */
 <T> T getFacade(Class<T> clazz);

 /**
  * Is the requested Facade interface available for this Resource?
  *
  * @param clazz Facade interface
  */
 boolean hasFacade(Class<?> clazz);

 /**
  * The MediaType of the original Resource from which this 
  * ResourceHandler was instantiated.
  */
 MediaType getMediaType();
}
\end{javalisting}

\autoref{fig:facade-ex-dependen} presents two example use cases for Facades. On
the left site the request method might want to know the full name of a submitted
contact resource. It therefor requests a Person facade. Different Person Facade
factories are registered. The different factories in turn have each a dependency
on an InputStream parameterized with a Media Type. The provided Media Type makes
the resolution path unambiguous.

The right site shows dependencies of Title and Summary Facades. Different
Factories would be provided that knows to create meaningful titles and summaries
for Persons, Events or Todo items independent of the original Media Types. A
title of a person surely includes the full name, for an event the date and event
title would be combined and a todo item could include the priority in the title.

    % Facades provide read-only access to the data
    % Facades can depend on other Facades and thus reuse work
    % Facades could do:
    %     Parse the InputStream with a common JSON/XML framework
    %     Could check whether the data represents a concept like a contact or calendar item, independent from the underlying Media Type (vCard, xCard, portable contacts, iCal, xCal)
    %     Could provide a transformation to another representation (XML<->JSON, xCard to portable contacts)
    %     could extract generic informations from different media types: Title, Authors, Updated, Summary
    % A Facade (Java Interface) that provides access to the Name of a Contact Resource could be implemented by different classes that could work either on vCard, xCard or Portable Contacts. The resource method does not need to be aware or the original media type of the data.

% The concept is powerful because Facades can easily be added without changing
% existing classes. In JAX-RS the resource Method needs to decide, on which
% representation of the data it wants to work. With this concept, a resource
% method could use several different available Facades to access the data.

% Using a similar concept to build representations (request Facades) for different MediaTypes may not be worth the effort.
% This would mostly be necessary to handle GET requests. GET requests however are expected to be idempotent and therefor should contain little to no internal side effects.
% It therefor seems to be reasonable to provide one GET request method for every produced Media Type.
% Specialized get requests may also execute faster than an approach that needs to dynamically build the processing pipeline.

\paragraph{Related work}
\label{sec:resourcefacadesrelated-work}

The idea for the Resource Facades concept was triggered by the use of the
JavaBeans Activation
Framework\footnote{\citeurl{http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index-135046.html}{2012-2-24}}
(JAF) in the JAX-RS specification. In this framework the DataHandler interface
provides access to available commands for a specific MediaType via the
getCommand method. The framework however was designed with the needs of a
Desktop clipboard in mind. Since JAF has been released for Java version 1.4 it
also does neither support Generics nor uses the advantages of immutability.

\cite{Pradel2008a} presents an approach and implementation in Scala to attach
roles to arbitrary objects. The work achieves type safe roles without extending
the underlying language. Using this library has been considered but it was
discovered too late to be included. Open questions are, how the declared media
type of a Resource could be considered in the selection of a role implementation
and how roles could depend on other roles. Another challenge would be to
preserve role instances and thus to avoid recreating them for every
invocation. If is furthermore required that roles implement a given
interface. The Resource Facade approach presented here is slightly different in
that creation of the facades is implemented independent from the facades
themselves by the factory classes.

JAX-RS provides the MessageBodyReader and -Writer interfaces. However these
interfaces are expected to be used only once per request. The resource method
afterwards needs to work with whatever interface was produced by the
MessageBodyReader. There exists no facility to request additional
transformations or facades of a Resource.

It is possible in JAX-RS to request a MessageBodyReader instance from the
javax.ws.rs.ext.Providers interface. This couldn't however help to get
additional Facades since the InputStream has already been consumed.

The concept shows similarities with Dependency Injection since dependencies of a
facade are also provided by an external component. It may be possible that the
concept could even be implemented on top of an existing Dependency Injection
framework.\footnote{Scala can provide Dependency Injection solely with language
  features via the so called ``Cake
  Pattern''. \citeurl{http://www.warski.org/blog/2011/04/di-in-scala-cake-pattern-pros-cons/}{2012-2-24}
  or Odersky: ``Scalable Component Abstractions''} Some aspects however may
require extra care:

\begin{itemize}
\item Resolving the dependencies of Facade factories must consider the Media
  Type of the input data.
\item The scope of an instance is bound to the ResourceHandler which in most
  cases may be equivalent to the Request scope, but this can't be guaranteed.
\item Each ResourceHandler manages its own view of available Facades.
\end{itemize}

The Apache Wink Rest Framework implements a concept called
``Assets''.\footnote{\citeurl{https://cwiki.apache.org/WINK/59-assets.html}{2012-2-28}}
Assets are containers for the resource data injected in or returned from
resource methods. Assets provide methods annotated with \lstinline:@Produces: or
\lstinline:@Consumes: to handle different Media types. In contrast to Resource
Facades, the set of supported media types of assets can only be extended by
extending the asset classes. It is also not possible like in listing
\ref{fig:facade-ex-dependen} to provide generic Facades for a title or a
summary.

\paragraph{Scala's type system}
The proposed Java class diagram in this section has the disadvantage that the
availability of a facade can not be checked at compile time. It seems however,
that a more advanced type system could help in this regard.

Listing \ref{fig:facades-with-scala-types} demonstrates features of the Scala
type system\cite{Odersky2011} that could be of interest here. In the example a
post method handler has the requirement to access the posted data through the
facades \lstinline:VCard: and \lstinline:TextSummary:. Additionally the data
should be forwarded to an implementation of the trait Storage which has its own
requirement for a facade.

Scala's ``compound types'' feature is used in line \ref{line-scala-compound} to
combine these requirements into an anonymous type. The ``type alias'' feature
allows it to assign the identifier \lstinline:MessageBody: to this anonymous
type and thus to keep the declaration of the \lstinline:post: method short and
readable.

\begin{javalisting}[label=fig:facades-with-scala-types,
                   numbers=left,
                   escapeinside={(*@}{@*)},
                   caption={Implementing the facades approach with Scala's type system}]
trait Storage[ReqFacade] {
 def create(id: String,
            body: ResourceHandler with FacadeFactory[ReqFacade])
}

class PostToCollection[StorageReqFacade]
            (storage: Storage[StorageReqFacade]) {
 type MessageBody = ResourceHandler (*@\label{line-scala-compound}@*)
                      with FacadeFactory[VCard] 
                      with FacadeFactory[TextSummary]
                      with FacadeFactory[StorageReqFacade]
  
 def post(body:MessageBody) : Response = {
  ...
  storage.create("id", body)
  ...
 }
}
\end{javalisting}

This example and the mentioned work on Scala roles shows that an advanced type
systems may be able to considerably improve the presented facades approach. A
more detailed study however is out of the scope of this work and the author's
comprehension of type systems.

\subsubsection{Other components}

\paragraph{Actions}
\label{sec:components-actions}

An action is basically the code that should be executed to respond to a client
request. An action receives all information about a request and is connected to
the application. It can use and manipulate the application state and produces a
data structure representing the response. It can be compared to the ``Request
method'' defined in JAX-RS.

% With JAX-RS it is not possible to define resource methods in different
% classes, i.e. annotating two different resource classes with the same path.

It is desirable to reuse actions across different consumed media types. Typical
tasks to perform in a POST or PUT resource method are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Transform the input format in a format suitable for the storage component.
\item Check the validity of the received data.
\item Extract information to be sent to another component, e.g. to notify users
  about changes or to index the new data for search.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{CollectionStorage}
\label{sec:collectionstorage}

The collection storage interface offers the necessary means to store and
retrieve resources. For clarity this interface is not further broken down into a
read-only part and a full read-write interface.

A collection storage is instantiated with the knowledge of the collection it is
responsible for. It therefor typically only returns resources that were
previously stored through it although it may share its underlying persistency
provider with other collection storage instances.

The life cycle of a collection storage is scoped to the application. It is
therefor possible to attach memory based caching to this component.

The storage does not expose any support for transactions. Instead every method
call represents one atomic action independent from other actions. Conditional
request execution is therefor in the responsibility of the storage. Listing
\ref{fig:evaluatepreconditions-concurrency}\footnote{found in the JAX-RS
  specification on page 28.} shows a possibility for a lost update. Another
request could have updated the resource between the etag check and the
\lstinline:doUpdate: call.

\begin{javalisting}[label=fig:evaluatepreconditions-concurrency,
                   caption={Potential lost-update problem with JAX-RS}]
ResponseBuilder rb = request.evaluatePreconditions(etag);
if (rb == null)
  return doUpdate(foo);
\end{javalisting}

\paragraph{Preparsed Request Components}
\label{sec:prep-requ-comp}

It seems like an obvious fact that could not be further deduced, that any
response action to a request must be preluded by a parsing of the request. In
the case of a REST application this parsing could be further divided in two
steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Parse URI, Accept Header and HTTP verb to select the Resource method
\item Resource method specific parsing as defined by annotations or done in the
  Resource method
\end{enumerate}

JAX-RS defines only rudimentary support for the second step by means of
inflexible annotations. Listing \ref{fig:jaxrs-annotated-queryparams} shows the
verbosity of parsing a set of standard query parameters for a search
interface. An alternative is shown in listing \ref{fig:request-components}. The
parsing of query parameters is delegated to the class
SearchRequest.\footnote{The QueryParams class is supposed to be an easy
  interface to access query parameters and apply rudimentary validation in one
  step.} The request method ``handleGet'' can access the parameters easily
through the injected SearchRequest instance.

\begin{javalisting}[label=fig:jaxrs-annotated-queryparams,
                   caption={Verbosity of parsing Requests with JAX-RS}]
@Get public Response get(@QueryParam("query") String query,
                         @QueryParam("sort-by") String sortBy,
                         @QueryParam("offset") int offset,
                         @QueryParam("limit") int limit ) {
\end{javalisting}

\begin{javalisting}[label=fig:request-components,
                   caption={Separating Request parsing from the Resource method}]
@GET @Inject
public Response handleGet(SearchRequest sr) { ... }

@RequestScoped
public class SearchRequest {
    public final String query, sortBy;
    public final int offset, limit;
    
    @Inject public SearchRequest(QueryParams qp) {
        query = qp.getNotEmpty("query");
        sortBy = qp.getOrElse("sort-by", "score");
        offset = qp.getPositiveIntOrElse("offset", 0);
        limit = qp.getPositiveIntOrElse("limit", -1);
    }
}
\end{javalisting}

The main advantages of this approach would be:

\begin{itemize}
\item Classes parsing commonly used query parameters can be reused.
\item The request method declaration gets much easier to read.
\item Sophisticated validation can be applied without obfuscating the request method.
\item Default values for unspecified input could depend on information only
  available at runtime instead of being provided as static value to the
  applications source code.
\end{itemize}

This approach is possible to implement for example with the dependency injection
support provided by the Jersey

  \caption{Building a processing pipeline with Dependency Injection}
  \label{fig:dependency-injection-pipeline}
\end{figure}

Paragraph \ref{sec:prep-requ-comp} used dependency injection to cause the
instantiation of a request scoped class that prepares information for the
request method (``handleGet'' in the example). This idea could be extended.

The information from the SearchRequest class is probably just forwarded by
``handleGet'' to another component that executes the search on a given
collection. Thus the request methot is ultimately interested on the search
result set to transform it into a response. Consequently the ``handleGet''
method could use dependency injection to request the result set and only start
working on this. Figure \ref{fig:dependency-injection-pipeline} visualizes the
hypothetic dependency graph of an application specific ResultSet class.

The figure shows how the CollectionStorage to search on is identified by the URI
path and the search parameters by the SearchRequest class of listing
\ref{fig:request-components}. The dependency injection is configured to produce
a ResultSet class by executing a SearchService with the request scoped
CollectionStorage and SearchRequest.

The idea might be an alternative implementation of processing pipelines as
proposed in \cite{Davis:2011:XTR:1967428.1967437} and worth exploring in a
separate work. One advantage of this approach would be that the processing
pipeline is defined and configured in the same language then the rest of the
application.

\subsection{Detailed Design Considerations}
\subsubsection{Inline feeds or feeds with links?}

ATOM entries can either carry the full content inline in the content tag or link to the content.

\begin{itemize}

\item feeds could be dynamically created and inline only those entries that the client has not yet seen as indicated by the provided ETag or timestamp.
\item Feeds with links will most probably result in many further requests by the client to get the individual entries
\item Inline feeds may cause unnecessary work and deliver entries that the client has already seen
\item A compromise could be to provide the first page of a paginated feed with links and all additional pages with inlined entries
\end{itemize}

A final decision about this subject should be done based on utilization and performance data of a real world installation.

\subsection{Client Design}

What needs a client to know, how does it need to work?
