    The above constraints are not an end in itself but lead to the following required or desirable
properties:
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">Cacheability  (5.1.4)  can  keep  the  data  available  also  in  offline  mode,  improves

      <li class="itemize">Simplicity helps to develop glue code to connect the application to other systems or to

      <li class="itemize">Modifiability allows to adapt the Groupware to changes in the organization.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Reliability should not need additional justification.

<span 
class="cmssbx-10x-x-120">2.6.0.3  Nested and mixed collections</span>&#x00A0;   The design should not unnecessarily hinder that
collections could be nested or contain different kinds of media types, e.g. calendar items and
contacts.
    <span class="cite">[<a 
href="restful_groupwareli2.html#XRFC6352">Dab11</a>, sec. 5.2]</span> forbids nested and mixed collections to ease the implementation of clients.
However both may make sense in certain scenarios and the protocol should not exclude such
scenarios. A collection could for example represent all items related to a project, which include
contacts, events, todos and notes.

 id="x13-15002r17"></a>
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.7  </span> <a 
 id="x13-160007"></a>Excluded requirements</h4>
<a 
 id="x13-16001r4"></a>
<span 
class="cmssbx-10x-x-120">2.7.0.4  Search</span>&#x00A0;   It is not required that the server implements any means to search its data. It is
not excluded that such a facility could be added later. It is however expected that searching could
be implemented separately. This could be done either on a synchronizing client or as a separate
system in the same administrative domain as the server.
<a 
 id="x13-16002r5"></a>
<span 
class="cmssbx-10x-x-120">2.7.0.5  Performance optimization</span>&#x00A0;   The system is meant to inherit the benefits of a restful
architecture. It should therefor be possible to attach separate caching intermediaries for read
requests. Rather then concentrating on the performance of the implementation of read requests it
should be taken care that the architecture supports external caching and thus avoids to serve the
same read request multiple times.
<a 
 id="x13-16003r6"></a>
<span 
class="cmssbx-10x-x-120">2.7.0.6  Access Control</span>&#x00A0;   The aspect of access control would broaden the scope of this work to
wide. However it could be kept in mind, whether the proposed design could be enhanced by a
separate access control design as proposed in <span class="cite">[<a 
href="restful_groupwareli2.html#Xconf/rest/GrafZLW11">GZLW11</a>]</span>.
<a 
 id="x13-16004r7"></a>
<span 
class="cmssbx-10x-x-120">2.7.0.7  Copying and Moving</span>&#x00A0;   WebDAV introduces the HTTP verbs to COPY and MOVE. The
usefulness of such functionality must of course be compared to the complexity of the
implementation and the drawback of incompatibility to plain HTTP.
    It is possible to enhance a restful API with copy and move functionality without extending
HTTP. The only requirement is that additional hyperlinks can be attached to the resources of the
API. Allamaraju <span class="cite">[<a 
href="restful_groupwareli2.html#XAllamaraju_2010">All10</a>, Ch. 11]</span> proposes &#8220;controller resources&#8221; that act on POST requests and
are linked from the resources they act on. Custom link relations are used to indicate the semantic
of the controller resource.
    This work does not include initial support for copy or move.

 id="x13-16005r8"></a>
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
<span 
class="cmssbx-10x-x-120">2.7.0.8  Versioning</span>&#x00A0;   WebDAV and therefor CalDAV and CardDAV support the versioning of
resources as an extension to the HTTP protocol. Versioning is an important feature for a text
authoring system that may have been the main target for the WebDAV protocol. It does however
seem to be of little use for the resources considered here. The resources are mostly created in one
session by one user and seldom modified.
<a 
 id="x13-16006r9"></a>
<span 
class="cmssbx-10x-x-120">2.7.0.9  Make Collections</span>&#x00A0;   WebDAV introduces the MKCOL HTTP verb to create collections.
CardDAV recommends that implementations support this to allow users to &#8220;organize their data
better&#8221;. An alternative would be to make use of ATOM categories for grouping. Instead of creating
a new (empty) collection the user would thus create a contact resource with a new category. An
ATOM service document could then link to a new (virtual) collection that only contains and
accepts resources of this category.
    TODO: What are the proposed ways to create collections? Post a feed to the service
document? Put a new service document? Put a feed document to the desired location?
<a 
 id="x13-16007r10"></a>
<span 
class="cmssbx-10x-x-120">2.7.0.10  Locking</span>&#x00A0;   As with Versioning, this is feature of WebDAV is not considered. Instead of
locking a resource HTTP supports conditional updates and leaves conflict resolution to the
client.
<a 
 id="x13-16008r11"></a>
<span 
class="cmssbx-10x-x-120">2.7.0.11  Push notifications</span>&#x00A0;   This work does not include any means to actively
notify (push) a client about changes happening on the server. The client needs to
initiate a request (pull) to the server to look for changes. However separate solutions
exist<span class="footnote-mark"><a
